Fourth Milestone project is focused on creating larger and complex web applications using Django to demonstrate the ability of solving real-world scenarios. Django is powerfull framework for rapid web development emphasizing reusability and use of its components. It contains number of applications, including authentication system, CRUD operations support and administrative interface including security features. 
Most of my professional life I've spent in restaurants so I decided to create web application for fictive take-away restaurant Crazy-Burger. This website will provide all convenient features as browse menu, place an order with payment, create user account or even use social media login to see or repeat previous orders.

<span id="ux"></span>
# 1. UX üëå
## 1.1 Strategy

The goal is to promote local restaurant by creating professional website. Online food ordering services can be quiet expensive for small businesses. Customers bill can easily drop by 20% if they will order directly over the restaurant webpage. However, the webpage must be also attractive, reliable, accesible and easy to use in order to become a success. User stories will help us identify all critical aspects.

### User stories
### Users

| 4 | Shopper | Responsive design | Order on a mobile device |
| 5 | Shopper | Add special note to order | State important information about my order |

## 1.2 Scope 

Based on the User Stories following features and components will be required in order to implement Minimum Viable Product so our app can be deployed.

- Welcoming home page with nice hero image
- Structured menu for navigation with extra links for each category
- Responsive design
- Page to display and sort all/selected category products
- Page to display all product details and option to buy this product 
- Search bar to avail users to find products
- Notification system with shopping bag updates
- Page to display shopping bag and update it
- Checkout page and a checkout confirmation
- Email checkout confirmation
- Register and login page with social media access
- Forgotten password feature
- User profile page and page to display previous order details
- Repeat previous order funcionality
- Page to add and edit products, remove product function
- Database and Media storage

## 1.3 Structure

Project will contain both the Front-End and Back-End code.

Front-End code will be written in HTML5 and styled with CSS3 and Bootstrap4 framework.
JavaScript will enable some Front-End dynamic features and some communication between Front-End and Back-End, e.g. submitting forms.

For progressive development Back-End code will be written in Python3 using Django framework. Django supports SQLite database where our data will be stored. In developments media and static files will be stored locally. For deployed version on Heroku our database will be handled by Postgress and static and media files will be stored with AWS S3.

## 1.4 Skeleton

Our project will be divided into few smaller applications: home, products, bag, checkout, and profiles.

Home application will be rendering our main home page.

Products application will contain data models for product Categories, Allergens, Toppings and Products themselves. It will be responsible for rendering the products and the product details pages and it will also serve admin to manage products in the store through Add Product and Edit Product views.

Bag application will provide access to the shopping bag with the funcionality of adding and removing products and also updating their quantity. Communication between the Bag and the other applications will be implemented using context processor.

Once all desired products will be in the bag a Checkout app will take user to the Checkout page to complete the order and make a payment following another page to confirm the order. To create an order from our shopping bag items we will need to attach these as line items using OrderLineItem model and attach it to an Order model.

Profiles application will manage basic information about our users and will allow them to see the Order History and to Repeat those orders with one click. User data will be stored using UserProfile model.

For Login, Logout, Registration and Password Management we will use Django package Allauth. This can also handle Login with Social Media accounts which is one of the requirements for this project.

## 1.5 Surface

For the design a Bootsrap 4 components and systems will be used. Bootstrap navbar will provide us with a dropdown menu and other navigation links. The main page will display an engaging hero image so the user will proceed to browse the menu. This will be enhanced with appropriate font and a color scheme. 
Pages shall remain responsive on keep the same format on all screen sizes. The only differnence on small and medium screens the header element will transfer to dropdown menu with a hamburger button and a search icon and products and product details will be stacked underneath each other.

# 2. Features üéÆ

Home page

The home page is divided into two elements, the header and the hero image. To implement the ease of use principles our header and navbar remains the same on the other pages too. The top left corner displayes CrazyBurger logo which also acts as a home button. There is a search bar in the middle section, and underneath is a dropdown menu divided into few product categories. Top right section contains user icon which provides links to register, login, logout, and also an admin link when admin is currently logged in to add products. Just next to it there is a shopping bag icon which brings users to their shopping bag.
The header and the main section is divided with a banner reminding users of a free delivery option if they spend more than ‚Ç¨50.
To attract the visitors the home page contains a large juicy burger and a red button Order Now next to it which directs user to the all food product page. 

Products page

The product page layout remains the same for all products or when a category is selected or the user is searching for particular product. There is a product image, product name and a category displayed. Product image and category serve as a links and will bring user to the product details page or will return category products respectively. For quicker navigation there are extra buttons which group some categories into larger chunks, e.g food products, meals and offers, desserts and other items in the store. Products can be sorted alphabeticaly, by price or category in both directions. 

Product details page

This page is split into two parts, left and right. There is a large product image on the left. The right side provides product name, product price, category, description and allergens. Some products can be bought as a meal deal with a drink or in a larger size. For these products Django will render an extra block underneath allergens and JavaScript will take care of the front-end dynamic part and will adjust the price or add extra text to the product name.




Admin add product
 If the product price_meal is larger than zero Django will render the page with option to upgrade product to a meal with a drink. JavaScript will open the drink section, change the displayed price and add text to the product name. Some other products can be purchased as a small or large. Both prices 
On mobile screens the image part is stacked above the product details section.
