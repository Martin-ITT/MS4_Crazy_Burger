### Milestone Project 4 - Full Stack Framework with Django
[live website here](https://deployed-website)
--------------------------------------

Fourth Milestone project is focused on creating larger and complex web applications using Django to demonstrate the ability of solving real-world scenarios. Django is powerfull framework for rapid web development emphasizing reusability and use of its components. It contains number of applications, including authentication system, CRUD operations support and administrative interface including security features. 
Most of my professional life I've spent in restaurants so I decided to create web application for take-away restaurant Crazy-Burger. This website will provide all convenient features as browse menu, place an order with payment, create user account for easier ordering or contact restaurant over contact form.

# 1. UX üëå
## 1.1 Strategy

The goal is to promote local restaurant by creating professional website. Online food ordering services can be quiet expensive for small businesses. Customers bill can easily drop by 20% if they will order directly over the restaurant webpage. However, the webpage must be also attractive, reliable, accesible and easy to use in order to become a success. User stories will help us identify all critical aspects.
