# Crazy Burger
## [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)
### Full Stack Web Development Course
### Milestone Project 4 - Full Stack Framework with Django
[live website here](https://crazyburger.herokuapp.com/)
--------------------------------------

Fourth Milestone project is focused on creating larger and complex web applications using Django to demonstrate the ability of solving real-world scenarios. Django is powerfull framework for rapid web development emphasizing reusability and use of its components. It contains number of applications, including authentication system, CRUD operations support and administrative interface including security features. 
Most of my professional life I've spent in restaurants so I decided to create web application for fictive take-away restaurant Crazy-Burger. This website will provide all convenient features as browse menu, place an order with payment, create user account or even use social media login to see or repeat previous orders.

# 1. UX üëå
## 1.1 Strategy

The goal is to promote local restaurant by creating professional website. Online food ordering services can be quiet expensive for small businesses. Customers bill can easily drop by 20% if they will order directly over the restaurant webpage. However, the webpage must be also attractive, reliable, accesible and easy to use in order to become a success. User stories will help us identify all critical aspects.

### User stories

## 1.2 Scope 

Based on the User Stories following features and components will be required in order to implement Minimum Viable Product so our app can be deployed.

- Welcoming home page with nice hero image
- Structured menu for navigation with extra links for each category
- Responsive design
- Page to display and sort all/selected category products
- Page to display all product details and option to buy this product 
- Search bar to avail users to find products
- Notification system with shopping bag updates
- Page to display shopping bag and update it
- Checkout page and a checkout confirmation
- Email checkout confirmation
- Register and login page with social media access
- Forgotten password feature
- User profile page and page to display previous order details
- Repeat previous order funcionality
- Page to add and edit products, remove product function
- Database and Media storage

## 1.3 Structure

Project will contain both the Front-End and Back-End code.

Front-End code will be written in HTML5 and styled with CSS3 and Bootstrap4 framework.
JavaScript will enable some Front-End dynamic features and some communication between Front-End and Back-End, e.g. submitting forms.

For progressive development Back-End code will be written in Python3 using Django framework. Django supports SQLite database where our data will be stored. In developments media and static files will be stored locally. For deployed version on Heroku our database will be handled by Postgress and static and media files will be stored with AWS S3.

## 1.4 Skeleton

Our project will be divided into few smaller applications: home, products, bag, checkout, and profiles. Home application will be rendering our main home page. Products application 



To implement the ease of use principles our navbar will be consinstent on all rendered pages. It will only change on smaller devices to achieve responsive design. From home page user can navigate to search and browse the products, register or login. On products page
